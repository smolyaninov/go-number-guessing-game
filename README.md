# Number Guessing Game CLI

This is my fourth project in Go, completed as part of  
the [Number Guessing Game project](https://roadmap.sh/projects/number-guessing-game) on roadmap.sh.

The goal was to practice Go basics with user input, control flow, modular project structure, and simple persistence ‚Äî by implementing a classic terminal game with scoring and difficulty levels.

The application is a command-line game where you try to guess a random number within limited chances, optionally using a one-time hint, and compete against your own high scores.

## Features

- Three difficulty levels:
    - Easy (10 chances)
    - Medium (5 chances)
    - Hard (3 chances)
- Random secret number between 1 and 100
- User feedback on each guess (‚ÄúHigher‚Äù / ‚ÄúLower‚Äù)
- One-time **hint system**: shows narrowed range + odd/even parity
- **Timer**: shows how long each round took
- **High scores**: per difficulty, saved locally in JSON
- **Replay loop**: keep playing until you quit
- Clean architecture with domain, engine, repo, and service layers

## Usage

```bash
guessing-game              # start the game
# Follow the prompts:
# - select difficulty (1/2/3)
# - enter guesses
# - optionally type -1 once to use the hint
```
